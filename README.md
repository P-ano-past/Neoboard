# Neoboard - Student & Instructor Management Platform

Neoboard is a platform designed for educational institutions, enabling instructors and students to manage their accounts and automate communication workflows. The app leverages **React.js** for the frontend, **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend, and integrates tools like **AWS SES** for email automation and **Discord** and **Canvas Instructure** for communication.

## üöÄ Key Features:
- **Account Management**: Implemented a comprehensive **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** system, allowing for secure account creation, password resets, and account deletions.
- **Frontend Components**: Built reusable UI components, including buttons, dropdowns, and forms using **React Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Automated Workflows**: Utilized **AWS SES** for automated password reset emails and **Discord** and **Canvas Instructure** integrations for sending messages to instructors and students.
- **Custom API Routes**: Developed robust backend API routes using **Express** and **Node.js**, ensuring smooth functionality for user management and automation processes.
- **Hosting**: Initially **Dockerized** for local development, but switched to **Railway.app** for deployment due to Docker-related conflicts with their setup.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Custom **RBAC** system
- **Email Automation**: AWS SES
- **Communication Integration**: Discord, Canvas Instructure
- **Hosting**: Railway.app (formerly Docker)
  
## üîß Development Highlights:

- **Email Automation**: Integrated **AWS SES** for sending password reset emails and setting up automated workflows for communication between instructors and students.
- **Hosting & Deployment**: Initially set up using **Docker** for local development, but transitioned to **Railway.app** for streamlined deployment, handling conflicts with Docker's procedures.

## üìà Roadmap:
Future features being considered include:
- Enhanced **user profile** management with a dashboard view for instructors and students.
- **Messaging system** improvements to allow more complex workflows with **Discord** and **Canvas Instructure**.
- **Additional security features** for account management and data encryption.

## üë• Team:
- **Team Size**: 2 developers
- **My Role**: Lead developer for frontend design, backend API routes, RBAC system, email automation, and integration with external services.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status:
